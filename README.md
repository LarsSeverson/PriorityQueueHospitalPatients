Hospital Patients Priority Queue

The standard queue works on the principle of first-in, first-out (FIFO) strategy i.e. the first element added
to the collection will always be the first element to be removed from the collection. However, this strategy
is often too simplistic and is not be applicable in many real-life activities. For example, in the medical field,
you need to schedule patients based on some priority. The patient with more severe health issues should
preempt other patients, even if they are waiting for an extended period. This is where priority queue
comes into picture. In priority queue, elements are added to the collection in an arbitrary order, but the
element with the highest priority will be the first to get removed. In this assignment, I will use priority
queue to model the heart transplant waiting list
